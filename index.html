            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p class="p2">My name is James Odell. I am a 33 year old male who was born and raised in Denver, Colorado. I
                have had the opportunity of working in multiple industries throughout my professional career. My first
                career was in the culinary arts as a chef. My second career has been in the Oil and Gas industry. I am
                naturally a creative person. So, working in Oil and Gas has not been fulfilling for my creative side. I
                would like to get back into an industry that can fulfill that creative desire of mine. I am currently
                attending Denver Universities, Coding Bootcamp. Some of the project you will see on this page are from
                my time in that Bootcamp program. I hope you enjoy my work and please feel free to contact me down
                below.</p>
