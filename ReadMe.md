In this project, I built my firt portfolio.

I tried out a lot of new and different HTML and CSS elements to get some experiance with the new elements. I only added one project to my portfolio, because I do not have any other projects to showcase. I plan on making changes to my whole portfolio throughtout this whole class as i learn new things. I worked myself into a few holes while making this, and i found that to be helpfull because I had to reverce engineer my way out of them.
